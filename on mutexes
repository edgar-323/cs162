       A mutex is a MUTual EXclusion device, and is useful for protecting shared data structures from concurrent modifications, and implementing critical sections and monitors.

       A  mutex has two possible states: unlocked (not owned by any thread), and locked (owned by one thread). A mutex can never be owned by two different threads simultaneously. A thread attempting
       to lock a mutex that is already locked by another thread is suspended until the owning thread unlocks the mutex first.

       pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__iinniitt initializes the mutex object pointed to by _m_u_t_e_x according to the mutex attributes specified in _m_u_t_e_x_a_t_t_r.  If _m_u_t_e_x_a_t_t_r is NNUULLLL, default attributes are used instead.

       The LinuxThreads implementation supports only one mutex attributes, the _m_u_t_e_x _k_i_n_d, which is either ``fast'', ``recursive'', or ``error checking''. The kind of a mutex determines  whether  it
       can be locked again by a thread that already owns it.  The default kind is ``fast''. See pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexxaattttrr__iinniitt(3) for more information on mutex attributes.

       Variables  of  type pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__tt can also be initialized statically, using the constants PPTTHHRREEAADD__MMUUTTEEXX__IINNIITTIIAALLIIZZEERR (for fast mutexes), PPTTHHRREEAADD__RREECCUURRSSIIVVEE__MMUUTTEEXX__IINNIITTIIAALLIIZZEERR__NNPP (for recursive
       mutexes), and PPTTHHRREEAADD__EERRRROORRCCHHEECCKK__MMUUTTEEXX__IINNIITTIIAALLIIZZEERR__NNPP (for error checking mutexes).

       pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__lloocckk locks the given mutex. If the mutex is currently unlocked, it becomes locked and owned by the calling thread, and pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__lloocckk returns immediately. If  the  mutex  is
       already locked by another thread, pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__lloocckk suspends the calling thread until the mutex is unlocked.

       If  the  mutex  is  already locked by the calling thread, the behavior of pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__lloocckk depends on the kind of the mutex. If the mutex is of the ``fast'' kind, the calling thread is sus‐
       pended until the mutex is unlocked, thus effectively causing the calling thread to deadlock. If the mutex is of the ``error checking'' kind, pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__lloocckk returns  immediately  with  the
       error  code EEDDEEAADDLLKK.  If the mutex is of the ``recursive'' kind, pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__lloocckk succeeds and returns immediately, recording the number of times the calling thread has locked the mutex. An
       equal number of pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__uunnlloocckk operations must be performed before the mutex returns to the unlocked state.

       pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__ttrryylloocckk behaves identically to pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__lloocckk, except that it does not block the calling thread if the mutex is already locked by another thread (or by the calling thread in
       the case of a ``fast'' mutex). Instead, pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__ttrryylloocckk returns immediately with the error code EEBBUUSSYY.

       pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__uunnlloocckk  unlocks  the  given  mutex.  The mutex is assumed to be locked and owned by the calling thread on entrance to pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__uunnlloocckk. If the mutex is of the ``fast'' kind,
       pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__uunnlloocckk always returns it to the unlocked state. If it is of the ``recursive'' kind, it decrements the locking count of the mutex (number of  pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__lloocckk  operations  per‐
       formed on it by the calling thread), and only when this count reaches zero is the mutex actually unlocked.

       On  ``error  checking'' and ``recursive'' mutexes, pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__uunnlloocckk actually checks at run-time that the mutex is locked on entrance, and that it was locked by the same thread that is now
       calling pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__uunnlloocckk.  If these conditions are not met, an error code is returned and the mutex remains unchanged.  ``Fast'' mutexes perform no such checks,  thus  allowing  a  locked
       mutex to be unlocked by a thread other than its owner. This is non-portable behavior and must not be relied upon.

       pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__ddeessttrrooyy  destroys  a  mutex  object, freeing the resources it might hold. The mutex must be unlocked on entrance. In the LinuxThreads implementation, no resources are associated
       with mutex objects, thus pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__ddeessttrrooyy actually does nothing except checking that the mutex is unlocked.

       None of the mutex functions is a cancellation point, not even pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__lloocckk, in spite of the fact that it can suspend a thread for arbitrary durations. This way, the status of mutexes at
       cancellation  points  is  predictable, allowing cancellation handlers to unlock precisely those mutexes that need to be unlocked before the thread stops executing. Consequently, threads using
       deferred cancellation should never hold a mutex for extended periods of time.

       The mutex functions are not async-signal safe. What this means is that they should not be called from a signal handler. In particular, calling pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__lloocckk or pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__uunnlloocckk  from
