/* Test your buffer cacheâ€™s ability to write full blocks to disk without reading them first. 
If you are, for example, writing 100KB (200 blocks) to a file, your buffer cache should 
perform 200 calls to block_write, but 0 calls to block_read, since exactly 200 blocks 
worth of data are being written. (Read operations on inode metadata are still acceptable.) 
As mentioned earlier, each block device keeps a read_cnt counter and a write_cnt counter. 
You can use this to verify that your buffer cache does not introduce unnecessary block reads. */
