t file format is used for this binary? And what architecture is it compiled for?
   file format is elf64-x86-64
   architecture is i386:x86-64

2. What are some of the names of segment/sections you find?
   "wc", "architecture", "Program Header", "Dynamic Section",
   "Version References", "Sections", "SYMBOL TABLE",
   "Disassembly of section .init", "Disassembly of section .plt",
   "Disassembly of section .text", "Disassembly of section .fini"


3. What segment/section contains main (the function) and what is the address of main?
   There seems to be a lot of references to main throughout the file, however,
   in segment "Disassembly of section .text:" there exists the section "000000000040069d <main>:"
   which contains the assembly code for main(). Also the address 000000000040069d matches
   0x40069d, which we stated in gdb.txt.

4. Do you see the stack segment anywhere? What about the heap? Explain.
   No. They don't seem to appear in the this info.
   This makes sense, though, since stack/heap info is produced at runtime.
